# Fix-Package-Clover-any-macOS
- First this fix was made on 07 / Nov / 2020 I had to reposition it because of some problem with Github
-  [Commits on Clover source](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/commit/11485426852c9f544a4a7049d846efeb195bad35)
 
### The main purpose of this Fix is to solve the Clover Package so that it can be installed on macOS Big Sur 11 and at the same time on all other macOS
